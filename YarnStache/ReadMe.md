# Yarnstache 

## Code Louisville C#/.NET Final Project July 21st, 2017

### Nicki Morris

``` YarnStache database (C#/.NET project) has been created as a feature on my Front End Web Development final project of my Kraft Me Knots craft website. The YarnStache database implements the CRUD application. Yarn entries can be created, read, updated, and deleted from the database to create a catalog  of yarns that I currently own. ```

**How to Run:**
1. Open Project in Visual Studio
2. Build and Run
3. Navigate to YarnStache page by clicking on the link in top center of home page. This is the portion of the site containing the database.
